## What is it?

shitemove is a Chrome plugin. When on a property listing it will take words such as 'stunning' and 'stylish' and replace them with words like 'passable' and 'tacky'.

Here are some examples that came up during testing:

![An estate agent listing with altered text. It says 'Cupboard. Winkworth art trying to shift part of an ex-council (meaning someone has made a tidy profit off of this) blog. Accommodation comprises of a separate fully fitted kitchen, a characterless bathroom and a disappointing living/bedroom area.'](/examples/example1.jpg?raw=true)

![An estate agent listing with altered text. It says '1 bedroom flat. SHORT LET. A disappointing and bog-standard one bedroom raised ground floor apartment presented in decidedly average condition throughout and featuring room with high ceiling and access to a lacklustre communal garden.'](/examples/example2.jpg?raw=true)

![An estate agent listing with altered text. It says '1 bedroom flat. Shit one bedroom first floor apartment in shit location'](/examples/example3.jpg?raw=true)

## Visit the website
I've put together an explanatory page over at <a href="http://shitemove.angryflatcap.com/">shitemove.angryflatcap.com</a>

## To do

<ul>
  <li>Accessibility improvements.</li>
  <li>Performance enhancements. I don't think that I'm using the MutationObserver API to its full potential at the moment.</li>
  <li><strike>A Firefox version (if there's enough demand for one)</strike></li>
  <li>Combine this repo with the <a href="https://github.com/liambutler/shitemove-firefox">shitemove for Firefox repo</a>, making use of the WebExtension API</li>	
</ul>

I haven't been working with HTML and Javascript for that long. If you have any tips on how I can make the interface more accessible or boost the performance, I'd love to hear from you.
